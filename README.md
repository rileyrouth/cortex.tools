# cortex.tools

A set of tools for Cortex Prime characters. Still in the very early stages.

I'm looking for advice on how I handle storing data in the main `character` object - I'm still a JavaScript novice, and I'm certain that I'm going about it in a horrible way. Using `find()` to get the linked trait set seems like it's not right, but I don't know how I should go about changing that. Any thoughts, message me :)
